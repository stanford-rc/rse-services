# What Levels of Service are Offered?

While the needs of a particular lab may vary, these are typically the levels
of service that can be matched with your needs for a project.

## Quick Support

If you need quick help with a bug, or any other task that is an hour or less,
this falls into the bucket of "Quick Support" and is provided as a service
to the entire Stanford Community.

## A La Carte

For items that might not be quick, but don't require a half or full time person,
we offer a set of a La Cart Services that can be assembled to your needs. For
example, you might need an analysis containerized, or a code base converted
to a module, or documentation written.

## Subscription

We have a quarterly subscription for labs that want to provide general support 
to their graduate students and staff, without knowing in advance the needs.

## Service Contract

If you have a project in mind that might need a dedicated person, or take
a longer period of time, you can hire a Research Software Engineer as a Service,
meaning that you require and can be granted a chunk of the RSE's time for a time
period that you need, or until a project is done to your satisfaction.

## Grant Funded

If you are interested in pursuring a project and seeking software support,
an RSE can be written into the requirements of a grant. This model is only different
from a service contract in that the objectives and statement of work is defined
by the grant.


## How do I know what I need?

You should open up communication with our team, and have discussion that will
allow us to better evaluate your needs. This can lead to a support plan, an 
agreement, and then the work! Take a look at [how it works]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started#how-does-it-work).
