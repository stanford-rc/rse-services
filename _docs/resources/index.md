# Resources

There is a lot that you can accomplish on your own, with a little help! Here
we share some of our templates and general resources that you can readily use
for your software. 

 - [Documentation](documentation) templates to quickly deploy beautiful docs for your code.
 - [GitHub Actions](github-actions) to help automate or generate content for your repositories.

{% include alert.html title="Would you like to request a resource?" content="If you are looking for a template that you think should exist and can't find it, let us know and we can develop it for you." %}

Would you like to see additional resources? Please [let us know]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new).
