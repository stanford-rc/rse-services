The following Google Cloud templates might be helpful to get you started to deploy
something on app engine, or run a workflow. If you need any help with customization or setting these
up, please don't hesitate to [reach out]({{ site.baseurl }}/support)

{% for action in site.data.templates.google-cloud %}
<h2 id="{{ action.title | slugify }}">{{ action.title }}</h2>
<a href="{{ action.url }}" target="_blank">
{% if action.image %}<img width="100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/templates/google-cloud/{{ action.image }}">{% else %}Link {% endif %}
</a>
<div>
    <strong>Description:</strong> {{ action.description }}
</div>
<hr>
{% endfor %}

All of these templates are open source, and available on GitHub, so if you see an issue
or would like to request a change, you can open an issue or pull request on the
