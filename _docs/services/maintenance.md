# Maintenance

Once you've finished your software, provided it as open source on GitHub,
written your paper, and you're ready to move on, you might be surprised if
issues start showing up for you to address. To ensure the reproducibility
and longevity of your work, it's essential to respond in a timely manner,
and help the interested party to fix bugs, review pull requests, and other
standard maintainer roles. If you're a busy person or you've moved on to
other projects, this additional responsibility can be a burden, and so we will
offer to do it for you. In addition to serving as maintainer for your code
repositories, in the case of open source software, we will also add it to a growing list of Stanford
maintained software. We are proud of the software and algorithms produced
by our University, and want to share that.
