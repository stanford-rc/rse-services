# High Performance Computing

Running a script on your local machine is one thing, but scaling the same task
to run on a supercomputer can be much more challenging. We can help! Whether you
are running on the [sherlock](https://sherlock.stanford.edu/docs), 
[SCG-4](https://srcc.stanford.edu/scg-genomics-cluster-genomics-scale),
or another local resource, RSE Services can help to:

 - Scale your an algorithm to run on HPC and/or cloud services
 - Containerize your script to make it reproducible
 - Write submission scripts to optimally run your jobs

Additionally, we can provide details about the execution of the jobs that
you can include in a methods section or similar.

Please [let us know]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new) how we can help.
