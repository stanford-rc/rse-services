# Services

We can help you with anything ranging from code development, to documentation,
and later maintenance of a final product. Want to see a more interactive
version of the below? You can also use our [services explorer]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tools/services/explorer/).

## General

 - [Software](software) including development of code, packages, testing, continuous integration, and containerization.
 - [High Performance Computing](hpc) including scaling an algorithm to run on HPC and/or cloud services
 - [Maintenance](maintenance) of code respositories including responding to issues and requests for the continued lifecycle of the software.

## Domain Specific

Some of our RSEs have domain-specific knowledge, and can optimally help in a domain of interest. If your group,
or school would like a research software engineer but aren't sure how we can help, here are some examples:

 1. **Support scientific packages**: to identify scripts that need optimization or other improvement. For example, a set of Matlab scripts might be more accessible for the community if converted to a Python package or extension.
 2. **Extend useful code**: for existing libraries that could use regular maintenance. It's common for a package to come out and be widely used, but then not get proper attention if the author cannot allocate the time.
 3. **Optimize Runtime** If your lab has existing pipelines that might be better optimized to run on HPC, we can help.


{% include alert.html title="Contribute to the publication domain" content="For all of these examples, the research software engineer can help contribute to the domain of published work. For example, if a Python package or extension is developed, it can be published to encourage broader use across the community." %}

More specific examples are included in the pages below.
