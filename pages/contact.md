# Request Services

There are many ways to engage with us to start working on a project! If you have a sense of
what you are looking for, you can use the [services explorer]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tools/services-explorer/) to select your needs and add any custom details. If you would like to track discussion over GitHub, we also invite you to [open an issue](https://www.github.com/{{ site.github_user }}/{{ site.github_repo }}). Otherwise,
fill out the form below to contact us with your needs:

<form action="https://formspree.io/vsochat@stanford.edu" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Your Name:
  <input class="form-input" type="text" name="name"><br>
  <label for="email">Your Email:
  <input class="form-input" type="email" name="_replyto"><br>
