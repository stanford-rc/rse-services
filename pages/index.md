## How can an RSE Help?

Here you can find support for:

 - Scaling of an algorithm to run on HPC and/or cloud services
 - Initial development of a code repository, including but not limited to creating packages, testing, containerization, documentation, and data provenance (e.g., DOIs).
 - Maintainer responsibility of a code repository, including responding to issues and addressing questions and feature requests for the continued lifecycle of the software
