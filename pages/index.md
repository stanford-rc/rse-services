# Research Software Engineering Services

This is the portal for research software engineering services from Stanford
Research Computing. Here you can find support for:

 - Scaling of an algorithm to run on HPC and/or cloud services
 - Initial development of a code repository, including but not limited to creating packages, testing, containerization, documentation, and data provenance (e.g., DOIs).
 - Maintainer responsibility of a code repository, including responding to issues and addressing questions and feature requests for the continued lifecycle of the software

See the [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page for more details. If you have a question or would
like to request support, please [Open an issue]({{ site.repo }}/issues).
